#  Mini Paint App

A small, fun Python GUI app I developed because I wanted my **own handwritten notepad** on Debian and it naturally evolved into a **full-fledged paint app**! 

Now you can draw, doodle, and unleash your creativity directly from Python.

## Features

*  **Draw freely** with your mouse
*  **Multiple colors** to choose from (black, red, blue, green, yellow, purple)
*  **Adjustable brush size** (small, medium, large)
*  **Clear the canvas** at any time
*  **Save your artwork** as a PNG image
*  **Smooth continuous lines**, even when moving the mouse fast

## Why I Made This

I started this project because I wanted a **handwriting notepad** on Debian. As I experimented with mouse input and drawing, the project naturally **evolved into a simple paint app** — now it’s a fun little creative tool I can tweak and improve over time.
